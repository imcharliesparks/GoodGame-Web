# To Do

### Core Systems
- [ ] Friends/visiting boards
- [ ] Exploring games by genre, publisher, etc.
- [ ] Add board collaborators

### Backend
- [ ] Rethink the way we're handling images (maybe only store ids for URLs?)

### Improvements
- [ ] Prioritize high-fidelity images for headers
- [ ] Add image carosel and redesign game page

### Bugs
- [ ] Fix crazy hits on the backend to games randomly

### UI
- [ ] Add game flow: make like pinterest and only show combobox with options first, after its added use an animation to show the other properties
